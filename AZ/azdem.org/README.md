# azdem.org

This set of data shows the differences between the azdem.org early voting information page as of October 31st and the same page as it is today (November 5th). The main difference being that on the archived page there is language regarding what type of pens to use and instructions stating to avoid using markers, while on the current page the language about pens and markers has been removed entirely.

# Background
This folder was created because there were hundreds of complaints by voters in Arizona stating that the voting centers had issued out sharpies for voters to vote with.  Those voters fear that the sharpies may have caused their ballots to be marked invalid because of the ink bleeding through the paper, causing what is called an "over-vote" error. The AZ Attorney General has sent a letter to the Maricopa County Elections Officials which can be found here:

** Project Veritas has also been receiving reports of sharpies being used in other states as well and posted on their Instagram page asking voters to come forward if they were issued sharpies or markers in their states.

# Why this is important
This is important information to be aware of because currently the media and several "fact-checkers" state the following:
 - That the claim that sharpies and markers would invalidate the ballots is false
 - That this has been proven on multiple occasions to be false
 
However, the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a major contradiction between what the media and "fact-checkers" are currently saying and what the azdem.org website was providing as instructions to Democrat voters just a few days ago.  Also, the letter from the AZ Attorney General seems to suggest that this situation is far from having been proven false on multiple occasions, and that further investigation is warranted. Another peculiarity is that the trending hashtag "sharpiegate" is being censored on social media, which could leave voters in the dark about the controversy surrounding the use of sharpies on a ballot, preventing them from checking that their vote was indeed counted and not invalidated should it be the case that they were issued a sharpie for use on their ballot.

It is in the best interest of all the AZ voters to have fair elections where every eligible citizen has an equal opportunity of their votes being counted rather than their votes being discarded for something as simple as having used a sharpie or marker.  We do our best to ensure that our children have the proper writing utensil for filling out scantrons during an exam, and that it is standardized for all students, so a good question to ask ourselves is why wouldn't we look into this question about sharpies/markers on ballots to make sure there's not a problem?  Staff at azdem.org, the media, "fact-checkers", and Big-Tech need to stop doing the people of AZ many injustices - injustices such as:
 - Removing evidence showing that a concern is valid (azdem.org)
 - Writing off their concerns as "false" and essentially gaslighting voters (media & "fact-checkers")
 - Censorship of voter's ability to spread something newsworthy (Big-Tech)
 
 All of that injustice erodes the integrity of the election process by making it difficult for the truth to prevail, potentially causing AZ votes to get censored on a massive scale as a result regardless of party affiliation.  And if sharpies were handed out equally to people of all parties, wouldn't it be in the Democrat's (not just Republican's) best interest to make sure that none of the votes from their voter base are being suppressed as a result of the wrong writing utensil being distributed?
